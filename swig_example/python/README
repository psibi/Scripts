README:

The main purpose of writing this README is that official doc's command don't work.

Working Example of SWIG with C++:
1) swig -c++ -python example.i
2) g++ -fpic -c example.c example_wrap.cxx -I /usr/include/python2.7/
3) g++ --shared example.o example_wrap.o  -o _example.so

Then start the Python interpreter and import example to verify it's working.
